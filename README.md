Sales analysis is examining sales reports to see what goods and services which have and have not sold well. The analysis is used to determine how to stock inventory, how to measure the effectiveness of a sales product, how to set manufacturing capacity and to see how the company is performing to achieve its goal.

In this project we're doing sales analysis during the Christmas which mainly deals with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python Libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn. The Project basically consist of enhancing the sales of the Retailer by recognizing top selling product distribution among the various age-groups. It also signifies the purchasing amount of customers based on their Gender,State,Marital Status, Occupation,Product Category and Product ID.

The main objective of this project is to analyze the behaviour of customers to buy the products during christmas and to suggest strategies which retailers can use accordingly to boost their sales.

<h3 align="left">Conclusion:</h3>

The project reveals that majority of the respondent is spending more amount of money during Christmas than the normal days whereas only very few respondents are spending less amounts since they are working in low profile based companies such as Textile and Agriculture. Hence it is clear that Christmas Sales have a huge impact on the spending of customers. 
The study on this project tries to understand the consumer behaviour during Christmas Sales which resulted in understanding the basic matters that influence customers while buying products during Christmas. Major item purchased during this season is Food,Clothing & Apparel and Electronics & Gadgets and there are lot of impulse purchases happening during Christmas. To tap this opportunities, designers, manufacturers, and sellers of respective products should be up to date with target consumer behaviour , so that they can utilise the opportunity well.
